### Hey 👋, I’m Semih — a **Full-Stack Human™** (matcha-powered)  

- 🛠 **Deep-Tech Founder** who turned “what if…?” into two shipped AI products at Solace.  
- 🧩 **Systems-Thinking Engineer** (Industrial Engineering × Computer Science) who sees the matrix & then writes the API.  
- 🚀 **Rapid Prototyper**: idea → code → user feedback → v2 **before** the espresso gets cold.  
- 🤖 **AI/ML Tinkerer** sprinkling LLMs & edge models wherever there’s latency to slay.  
- 🎨 **UX Believer** because elegance isn’t optional (and dark-mode is table stakes).  

> “Ship early, laugh often, automate the boring bits.”

Currently hacking on agentic dev workflows, generative-media infra, and the occasional dad-level joke in commit messages.  

Let’s build something cool together — PRs & coffee memes welcome!
